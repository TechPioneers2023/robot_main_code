# Keysight Engineering Challenege 2023

We Team Techpioneers have developed a mobile remote-controlled robot featuring two-wheel differential drive, OpenCV visual processing, TCP-IP protocol and an intuitive UI control interface. 
Our robot movements are directly controlled through an Arduino Mega 2560 board, which receives instructions from a Raspberry Pi through UART connection. 
Our Raspberry Pi is in turn controlled through a wireless connection to a local server through which control signals are sent on a UI interface on a mobile device.
