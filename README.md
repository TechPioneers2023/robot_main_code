# Keysight Engineering Challenege 2023

We Team Techpiorneers have developed a mobile remote-controlled robot featuring two-wheel differential drive, enhanced with OpenCV visual processing, TCP-IP link layer, intuitive control UI interface and PID locomotion system. 
Our robot movements are directly controlled through an Arduino Mega 2560 board, which receives instructions from a Raspberry Pi through UART connection. 
Our Raspberry Pi is in turn controlled through a wireless connection to a local server through which control signals are sent on a UI interface on a mobile device.
